# Checklab

**Checklab** is an open-source archived library that preserves **abandoned, crucial, and future-oriented** repositories, research papers, and digital assets.  
It exists to give forgotten innovations a second life — enabling people to **study**, **collaborate**, and **build upon** them.



Whether it's an incomplete AI model, an old simulation, or a concept paper with promise — Checklab is where it’s stored, explored, and potentially revived.

## ❗ Project Status

I am **no longer actively maintaining** Checklab.  
However, I believe in its purpose and want it to live on.

> ✅ **The community is now free to use, fork, improve, and evolve it** however they see fit.

Feel free to build on top of it, adapt it for your use case, or take it in an entirely new direction.
