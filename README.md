# Checklab

**Checklab** is an open-source archived library that preserves **abandoned, crucial, and future-oriented** repositories, research papers, and digital assets.  
It exists to give forgotten innovations a second life — enabling people to **study**, **collaborate**, and **build upon** them.

Whether it's an incomplete AI model, an old simulation, or a concept paper with promise — Checklab is where it’s stored, explored, and potentially revived.

## 🔍 What It Is

- A **community-driven archive** of abandoned yet meaningful digital work.
- A **collaborative platform** for researchers, developers, and explorers to revisit and build upon forgotten ideas.
- A space where digital artifacts that **never got their chance** are given one.
